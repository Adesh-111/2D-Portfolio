## 💡 About the Project  
I wanted to try something unique for my portfolio, inspired by the many creative 3D developer portfolios out there. This time, I decided to make a **2D game portfolio**—a fun and engaging way to stand out!  

This project was also inspired by someone’s wish to see a game-style portfolio. So, I turned that idea into reality to create something fun and memorable.  

### Features  
- Built with **Kaboom.js** for the game mechanics.  
- Map design created using **Tiler**.  
- Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
